Reddit is a platform that allows users to upload posts and comment on them, and is divided in _subreddits_, often covering specific themes or areas of interest (for example, [world news](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/), [ukpolitics](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/) or [nintendo](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo)). You are provided with a subset of Reddit with posts from Covid-related subreddits (e.g., _CoronavirusUK_ or _NoNewNormal_), as well as randomly selected subreddits (e.g., _donaldtrump_ or _razer_).\n","\n","The `csv` dataset you are provided contains one row per post, and has information about three entities: **posts**, **users** and **subreddits**. The column names are self-explanatory: columns starting with the prefix `user_` describe users, those starting with the prefix `subr_` describe subreddits, the `subreddit` column is the subreddit name, and the rest of the columns are post attributes (`author`, `posted_at`, `title` and post text - the `selftext` column-, number of comments - `num_comments`, `score`, etc.).\n","\n","In this

Depending on the nationality, origin and/or political beliefs different people might react differently to the same content(Yoo, J., Dutra, S.V.O., Fanfan, D. et al., 2020). Luckily, our team consists of people with different backgrounds and ages. Diversity plays a big part in this project since different people with such different ethical backgrounds can analyze and sort information differently(Sylvia Ann Hewlett, Melinda Marshall, and Laura Sherbin, 2013). It helps a lot in identifying misuse of information or straight-up hate. The biggest problem, in my opinion, in identifying such content as potentially harmful is that it might offend some people even if an article or a post is written for educational reasons. In the modern world, people, in their masses, are getting offended more and more each coming day, even if statements are backed by the research and were not intended to insult or hurt, but rather to teach and educate. For me, this is where the line should be drawn. One just canâ€™t please everyone. We have a whole world at our fingertips to search, analyze and think about the information we gather from different sources. Nobody is forcing anyone to read or react to everything they see. Nobody has cancelled freedom of expression, as long as there is no hate speech or a direct intent to repress. Transparency is key with information of this kind, since it may save lives, which is the most important thing we have. However, every content on this topic needs to be carefully reviewed, as, even if itâ€™s properly cited, there is always a chance for misuse of information. Social media is a great platform for the freedom of speech, however, there has been little to no accountability, among regular people, to one's words (Harry Bruinius, 2018). Anyone can, basically, write anything they wish, whether itâ€™s true or false, right or wrong, or offensive or harmless. We should always remember that we do not know who is sitting behind the device, from which those messages are sent. This is where Data Science comes into clutch. With the power of machines, we can sort out information faster than it reaches people, who might not be very pleased with the information provided. However, we should be fair to each publication, regardless of its origin. The only things which should matter are its intent, wording, conclusion and proper use of information. A particular solution to the misuse of information could be an implementation of responsibilities by the government. Although superficially existent, the governmentâ€™s intervention in particular cases of the use of information would be of great help to society as a whole, since people need to only know the truth about the topics of such seriousness. Everyone must feel obligated to provide well-researched information, as well as a valid interpretation of it, in order to not mislead others, as it can cause severe damage to the readers as well as to lots of people around them. Such touchy topics like COVID, need to be highly monitored at all times, as it's in the governmentâ€™s interest to convey reliable and truthful information to its citizens, permanent and temporary residents.\n","\n","References\n","\n","Yoo, J., Dutra, S.V.O., Fanfan, D. et al.
